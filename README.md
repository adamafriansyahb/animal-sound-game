# animal-sound-game

A part of learning jQuery. 

Inspired by and based on https://londonappbrewery.github.io/Simon-Game/.

Minor modifications include: 
- For each level, all of the pictures selected by computer are animated sequentially (from the first to the last chosen one), instead of just animating the last chosen picture.
- Adding animal picture to each button.
- Using different sound effects (animal sounds).
